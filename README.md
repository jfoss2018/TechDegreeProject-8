Treehouse Project #8

This project focuses on setting up Gulp as a task manager to streamline the workflow of the user.

To use this project file, you must file install all dependencies by running "npm install."

Once all dependencies are installed, the following tasks will be available to run:
1. gulp scripts - Concatenates and minifies .js files. Includes a map file.
2. gulp styles - Compiles .scss files into a .css file and minifies. Includes a map file.
3. gulp images - Compresses images.
4. gulp clean - Deletes all files/folders that were created by tasks.
5. gulp build - Runs the clean task before running all other tasks to build a complete production folder (dist).
6. gulp - Runs the build task before serving the files and watching for changes to .scss files.
